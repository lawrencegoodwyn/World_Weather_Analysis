# World_Weather_Analysis
## Summary
  This project takes a look at different weather conditions around the world, using an OpenWeatherMap api key to pull current weather statuses from 2,000 longitudes and latitudes across the globe. Then, an analysis shows the relationship between a location's latitude and longitude based on max temperature, humidity, cloudiness, and wind speed. Furthermore, it allows a user to input a desired temperature maximum and minimum to output a range of cities that fulfill those temperature requirements and gives them a possible itinerary, with possible hotels included. 
  ### Tools
    *Google API keys
    *OpenWeatherMap API keys

This code provides users with a great way to find an ideal destination based off of temperature. A modification of this code could be made to look for ideal destinations in the future, using other and more costly advanced API keys from OpenWeatherMaps, but the tools are at the user's disposal. In sum, this code is great tool for a user looking to make a quick decision on a few places to go around the world while only inputting temperatures.
